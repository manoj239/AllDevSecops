🔹 Agile Azure Dashboards
In Azure DevOps, dashboards are a visual workspace that helps teams and managers track progress and manage work.
Key components you’ll commonly see:
Work Items – Individual tasks, bugs, user stories, or features to be completed.
Backlogs – Ordered lists of work items that represent the product roadmap.
Boards (Kanban/Scrum boards) – Visual representation of workflow stages (To Do → In Progress → Done).
Sprints – Iteration-based work planning (usually 2–3 weeks).
Queries – Customized filters to track specific sets of work items.
In this backlog, we will add everything , so that we can able to know, how much time will it take to take the each  task and how many tasks are present
